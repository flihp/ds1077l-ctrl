# Background
The Maxim DS1077L oscillator is attached to the I2C bus as a slave. It has 3
registers that we can set to define its behavior. For details on the structure
of these registers and how they effect the behavior of the device consult the
spec sheet.

# Overview
This is a collection of utilities for getting and setting the state of these
registers. Each utility is specific to a register. To identify the DS1077L that
we're operating on, each utility takes an optional --address and --bus-dev
argument. I2C bus address are 10 bits long though the DS1077L only allows for
the lower 3 bits to be changed and so the --address parameter must be in the
range 0x58 - 0x5f. The --bus-dev option specifies the device node associated
with the I2C bus the DS1077L is attached.

Additionally each utility takes a --get or a --set parameter to specify whether
the user wishes to display or set the state of a specific register. To get the
register state the user must specify the --get option. To set the register
state the user must specify the --set option along with a series of options
specific to the register that define the register state.

# Building
These utilities are specific to Linux and depend on the Linux I2C userspace
headers. On Debian these are available through the libi2c-dev package. Once
these are installed the ds1077l-ctrl tools are built with the typical make
commands:

$ make
$ sudo make install
